<h1>osTicket - Post-Install Configuration</h1>
This tutorial outlines the post-install configuration of the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)


<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>
Now that our osTicket is installed and running, I started to configure it via the admin control panel. Next, I created a "Supreme Admin" role with full permissions, a "SysAdmins" Department, and an "Online Banking" team. After I did that, I created two new Agents John and Jane Doe and assigned them to each department, granted them the Supreme Admin role, and also assigned them to the Online Banking team. Lastly, in the Agent Panel I created two new Users/Customers Karen and Ken.

<p>
My last step in configuring osTicket was to set our SLAs, and configure our Help Topics.
